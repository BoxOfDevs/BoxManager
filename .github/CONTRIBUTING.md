# BoxManager contributing guidelines

Hello there! Thank you for your interest in contributing to BoxManager.
Here are the guidelines:

Code should be written so that users without the command line can still use the script.
We preferably want code in PHP or HTML, if you use other languages, make sure users can easily use it without having to install extras.

You must provide a way to let the Admin CP edit the script (if it is a site configuration one).
